# Exploring Airline Data

### Description
Most of us were likely on a plane over the holidays, and chances are that at least one of our flights got delayed. So how well do different airlines do? In this analysis, I will perform data wrangling and exploratory data analysis based on the following information: [aircraft incidents](https://github.com/makwingchi/Exploring-Airline-Data/blob/master/aircraft_incidents.htm), [routes](https://github.com/makwingchi/Exploring-Airline-Data/blob/master/routes.dat.txt), [airlines](https://github.com/makwingchi/Exploring-Airline-Data/blob/master/airlines.dat.txt), [airports](https://github.com/makwingchi/Exploring-Airline-Data/blob/master/airports.dat.txt), and [incidents(raw texts)](https://github.com/makwingchi/Exploring-Airline-Data/blob/master/incidents_raw.txt).

### Required Libraries
- `csv`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `requests`
- `io`
- `bs4`
- `re`
- `nltk`
- `sqlite3`

### Result
The details of the analysis are included in [notebook1](https://github.com/makwingchi/Exploring-Airline-Data/blob/master/notebook1.ipynb) and [notebook2](https://github.com/makwingchi/Exploring-Airline-Data/blob/master/notebook2.ipynb) in the repository.
